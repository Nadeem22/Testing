Subject: Clarification Required on Current Project Allocation

Dear [Manager's Name] and [Workforce Management Team],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing in regards to an email I received from the Workforce Management Team, requesting me to appear for an interview for project allocation. While I appreciate the opportunity, I wanted to clarify that I am currently engaged with a project under the supervision of [Manager's Name].

I understand that due to a software issue, there may be some discrepancies in the staffing details which could have led to this confusion. Therefore, I would kindly request [Manager's Name] to communicate this to the Workforce Management Team at the earliest convenience to ensure accurate staffing information is maintained.

I believe that such a clarification would rectify the current misunderstanding and allow me to continue my commitment to the ongoing project, ensuring optimal productivity.

Thank you for your understanding and prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
